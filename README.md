# About this Fork

- Some general information about the project has been removed (to reduce overhead in tracking the project).  Please see the main repository for inspiration, FAQ, etc.
- Some changes will be incorporated to better suit it for my environment (MacOS / Sublime Text).  Per runs Visual Studio on Windows and makes use of the VS debugger.  In this repo, scripts and tooling will be built around Sublime Text and LLDB.
